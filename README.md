# Maven-Pizza-Challenge
This repository contains my solution to the [Maven Pizza Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-pizza-challenge), where I assumed the role of a BI Consultant for Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired restaurant in New Jersey. The objective was to design a single-page interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and sales performance.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- KPI Metrics: Total revenue, average order value, and pizza sales distribution.
- Time Series Analysis: Daily and cumulative revenue trends.
- Sales Performance: Top-selling pizzas and least popular items.
- Operational Insights: Order frequency by day and hour, seating utilization.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
Data Preparation: Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.
Visualization: Power BI for dashboard development.
